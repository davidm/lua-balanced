   summary    = "Functions for matching delimited snippets of Lua code in a string",
   detailed   = [[
     This module can, for example, match a Lua string, Lua comment, or Lua expression.
     It is useful in particular for source filters or parsing Lua snippets
     embedded in another language. It is inspired by Damian Conway's
     Text::Balanced in Perl. The unique feature of this implementation is
     that that it does not rigorously lex and parse the Lua grammar.
